# Building

The project includes several shell scripts to streamline common tasks.

## Development Build Script

Use this to build development version of the package:

```bash
./build-dev
```

This script:

1. Creates/activates a virtual environment (`env/`)
2. Installs Maturin if not present
3. Generates Python stub files (`.pyi`)
4. Builds and installs the extension module in development mode

The development build is faster but not optimized. After running, the virtual environment should be active. If not, it can be activated via:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

The `kaspa` Python module can than be imported and used in Python.

## Release Build Script

Use this to build release version and wheels of the package:

```bash
./build-release
```

This script:

1. Creates/activates a virtual environment
2. Generates stub files (release mode)
3. Builds optimized wheel (`.whl`) and source distribution

Output files are placed in `target/wheels/`.

## (Approximate) CI Validation Script

```bash
./check
```

This script runs the following:

1. `cargo fmt --all` - Format Rust code
2. `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` - Lint Rust code (warnings as errors)
3. `./build-dev` - Build the extension
4. `pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"` - Install dependencies
5. `pytest tests/unit -v` - Run unit tests
6. `pytest tests/integration -v` - Run integration tests
7. `mkdocs build --strict` - Verify documentation builds
